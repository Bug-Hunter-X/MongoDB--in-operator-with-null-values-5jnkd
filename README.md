# MongoDB $in Operator with Null Values
This repository demonstrates a common error when using the `$in` operator in MongoDB queries with arrays containing `null` values. The `$in` operator behaves unexpectedly in such cases, leading to incorrect query results.

## Bug Description
The provided code snippet shows an incorrect usage of the `$in` operator.  When an array passed to `$in` contains `null`, it doesn't correctly match documents where the field is `null`.

## Solution
The solution involves handling `null` values separately using the `$or` operator to explicitly check for `null` values in addition to the other values in the array.  This ensures that documents where the field is `null` are included in the query results if intended.
